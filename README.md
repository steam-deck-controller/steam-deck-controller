# SteamPad: A SteamDeck inspired gamepad!

<img src="./media/Preview.jpg" width="250" align="right">

Convert your spare Steam Deck parts into a fully functional standalone controller! This project aims to repurpose original Steam Deck components into a custom-designed handheld controller.

For the time being, this controller is wired only. A full wireless solution may come at some point in the future!

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create a standalone controller using original Steam Deck (LCD-Deck) parts
- Design and provide 3D printable shell (hopefully compatible with resin / FDM printers)
- Provide possibility for a basic wired-only controller build

## ✅ Current Progress

- [x] USB pinout reverse engineering completed ([details](./research/Controller_Boards.md))
- [x] Basic wired proof-of-concept showing the possibility ([demo video](https://youtu.be/daWLg8Y8ThU))
- [x] Design FFC to USB-C Breakout PCB
  - For development purposes
  - [Optional] for wired-only controller builds
- [x] Design 3D printable shell prototype (_Resin / FDM / SLS is TDB_)
- [ ] Create detailed assembly guide
- [ ] TBD

### 🤔 Why this approach?

- **Driver-Free Operation**: The USB dongle will emulate the original USB descriptors, allowing the controller to work without additional drivers.
- **No Additional Software**: The controller will work out-of-the-box via Steam.
- **No Firmware Modification**: The controller will work with the original Steam Deck firmware.
